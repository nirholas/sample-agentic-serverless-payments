# Agentic and Serverless Payments on AWS

**Authored by:** Chris Wajule and Simon Goldberg

This solution demonstrates pay-per-use AI content generation using the x402 payment protocol (v2). Users pay with USDC on Base Sepolia to access Amazon Nova 2 Lite for text and Amazon Nova Canvas for image generation. Two payment architectures are included: the serverless flow where users sign payments via browser wallets, and the agentic flow using the Strands agent powered by Amazon Bedrock AgentCore with CDP AgentKit, both utilizing the x402.org facilitator to verify signatures and settle payments on-chain via EIP-3009 transferWithAuthorization.

## Architecture

### Serverless

![AWS Serverless x402 Payments Architecture](assets/AWS-Serverless-X402-Payments.png)

The solution includes three main components: Request Initiation (salmon arrows, steps 1-2, 5, 11), Payment Processing (green arrows, steps 3-4, 6-7, 9), and Content Delivery (orange arrows, steps 8, 10).

The numbers in the following flow correspond to the serverless stablecoin payment for AI-generated content:

1. **Wallet Connection:** The user clicks the wallet connect button in the React frontend. The application uses Reown AppKit to display available wallet options. The user selects their wallet and approves the connection request.

2. **Initial Request:** The user submits a prompt through the chat interface. The application sends a POST request to the `/generate` endpoint on Amazon API Gateway without payment credentials.

3. **Cost Estimation:** The Estimator Lambda function uses Amazon Bedrock `CountTokens` API to calculate input tokens. It estimates output tokens using a conservative formula (minimum 800 tokens with 20% safety margin) and estimates pricing based on the selected model.

4. **Payment Requirements:** The Seller Lambda function detects the missing `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header and returns `HTTP 402`. The response includes the USDC amount in wei, the seller wallet address, the USDC contract address on Base Sepolia, and `EIP-712` domain parameters.

5. **Payment Authorization:** The frontend is hosted on AWS Amplify and displays a payment modal with the cost preview. The user confirms and the application generates an `EIP-712` typed data signature using the connected wallet. The wallet prompts the user to sign the message. The signature authorizes the USDC transfer with validity timestamps and a unique nonce.

6. **Payment Submission:** The frontend retries the `/generate` request with the `EIP-712` signature in the `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header. The Base64-encoded payload uses the x402 v2 shape `{ x402Version: 2, payload: { signature, authorization }, accepted }`, where the authorization object holds (from, to, value, validAfter, validBefore, nonce) and `accepted` echoes the chosen payment requirements.

7. **Payment Verification:** The AWS Lambda function sends the payment payload to the x402.org facilitator's `/verify` endpoint. The facilitator validates the `EIP-712` signature against the USDC contract domain on Base Sepolia.

8. **Content Generation:** The AWS Lambda function invokes the Bedrock Lambda function. For text, it calls Amazon Nova 2 Lite using the `invoke_model` API. For images, it invokes Amazon Nova Canvas.

9. **Payment Settlement:** After successful content generation, the Lambda calls the facilitator's `/settle` endpoint. The facilitator executes the USDC transfer on-chain using `EIP-3009 transferWithAuthorization` and returns the transaction hash. The Lambda includes the settlement details in the `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header.

10. **Response Delivery:** The Bedrock Lambda returns the generated content. The Seller Lambda constructs a response with the success message, transaction url (`https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/{hash}`), and generated content.

11. **Frontend Display:** The application displays the payment confirmation, transaction hash, and AI-generated content in the chat interface.

### Agentic

![AWS Agentic x402 Payments Architecture](assets/AWS-Agentic-X402-Payments.png)

The solution includes three main components: Request Initiation (salmon arrows, steps 1-2), Payment Processing (green arrows, steps 4-10, 12), and Content Delivery (orange arrows, steps 3, 11, 13-14).

The numbers in the following flow correspond to an autonomous agent executing stablecoin payments for AI-generated content:

1. **WebSocket Connection:** The user connects to the Amazon API Gateway WebSocket endpoint. The Connect Lambda stores the connection ID in Amazon DynamoDB.

2. **User Request:** The user sends a prompt with a session ID via a WebSocket connection. The Agent Lambda forwards the request to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime `/invocations` endpoint. The request includes a session ID for isolation.

3. **Agent Initialization:** Amazon Bedrock AgentCore loads the agent configuration and initializes Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory for session storage. The agent using Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 as the reasoning engine, receives the prompt and determines the required action.

4. **Cost Estimation:** The agent invokes the `estimate_image_cost` tool. The tool calculates the cost and generates a unique request ID. The cost, prompt, and authorization status (`auth: false`) are stored in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory.

5. **Authorization Check:** The agent calls `generate_image` tool. The tool checks the authorization status in session storage and finds `auth:false`. The tool returns `AUTHORIZE_CHECK` status directly to the agent without calling the gateway. This confirms user intent to pay and is not part of the x402 flow. The check is automatic but can be an explicit natural language confirmation corresponding to an CDP AgentKit wallet’s allowance.

6. **Payment Authorization:** The agent calls `make_payment`. The tool verifies sufficient balance exists and sets `auth:true` in session storage. This marks the user's intent to proceed with payment but does not transfer funds.

7. **Initial x402 Request:** The agent calls `generate_image` again. The tool finds `auth:true` and creates an x402 HTTP client that signs with the CDP AgentKit wallet through CDP APIs (no private key export). The client sends a POST request to Amazon API Gateway without an `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header.

8. **402 Payment Required:** AWS Lambda receives the request and returns `HTTP 402` with payment requirements. The response includes the USDC amount in wei, seller wallet address, USDC contract address, and `EIP-712` domain parameters (name: 'USDC', version: '2', chainId: 84532).

9. **EIP-712 Signature Generation:** The x402 client receives the 402 response and constructs `EIP-712` typed data. It requests a signature from the CDP-managed wallet, base64-encodes the signature payload, and retries the POST request with the signature in the `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header.

10. **Payment Verification:** Lambda extracts the payment payload from the `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header. Lambda sends the signature to the x402.org facilitator's `/verify` endpoint, which validates the `EIP-712` signature against the USDC contract domain on Base Sepolia.

11. **Image Generation:** The tool invokes Amazon Nova Canvas model using the `invoke_model` API. Nova Canvas generates a `1024x1024` image based on the prompt.

12. **Payment Settlement:** After successful image generation, the tool calls the seller Lambda's `/settle` endpoint with the nonce. Lambda looks up the pending payment data, calls the x402.org facilitator's `/settle` endpoint, and the facilitator executes the USDC transfer on Base Sepolia using `EIP-3009 transferWithAuthorization`. The transaction hash is returned to the agent.

13. **Response Delivery:** The generated image is stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service, and its unique ID is stored in session storage. The agent returns a success message to the frontend hosted on AWS Amplify which includes the base64-encoded image, transaction hash, and a BaseScan explorer link (`https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/{hash}`) for on-chain verification.

14. **Session Cleanup:** The tool clears the current request ID from session storage. This allows new image generation requests while maintaining payment history for the session.

## Architecture Comparison

### Use Case Alignment

Serverless handles simple, transactional interactions. Users know what they want, need a single piece of content, and prefer explicit control over each payment.

Agentic targets complex, exploratory workflows. Users describe goals in natural language, iterate on content through conversation, or delegate payment decisions within spending limits.

### Image Handling

Serverless returns images directly in HTTP response bodies. For small images or when clients handle base64 encoding, this provides the simplest implementation.

Agentic offloads images to Amazon S3 due to WebSocket message size constraints. This adds complexity but enables handling large media files. Presigned URLs provide secure, temporary access.

### Payment Models

Serverless implements pay-per-request semantics. Each API call requires separate payment authorization. Users explicitly approve every transaction.

Agentic implements pay-per-session semantics. Users authorize a session budget. The agent manages spending within that limit across multiple operations.

### Communication Patterns

Serverless uses synchronous HTTP request-response patterns. Each request is independent and expects a single response.

Agentic uses asynchronous WebSocket bidirectional streaming. Connections persist across multiple message exchanges. This enables server-initiated messages and incremental response delivery.

### State Management

Serverless is stateless. AWS Lambda functions have no memory of previous requests. Clients maintain all session context.

Agentic maintains session state through Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory. The agent remembers conversation history, user preferences, and cumulative spending within a session.

### Orchestration Models

Serverless orchestration is explicit and deterministic. The Seller Lambda follows a fixed sequence: check payment, verify authorization, invoke generation, return results.

Agentic orchestration is autonomous and adaptive. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime decides which tools to invoke based on user intent. The agent handles variations in request structure and adapts to errors.

### Scalability

Serverless scales horizontally without coordination overhead. Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda handle thousands of concurrent requests. Cold starts are the primary latency consideration.

Agentic scalability is constrained by WebSocket connection limits and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime capacity. Connection pooling and lifecycle management become operational concerns.

### Latency Profiles

Serverless incurs cold start latency when AWS Lambda functions initialize. Subsequent requests to warm functions complete quickly.

Agentic maintains warm WebSocket connections, eliminating connection establishment overhead. However, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime introduces reasoning latency as Claude Sonnet 4.5 analyzes prompts and plans tool invocations.

## Scaling with CloudFront and Lambda@Edge

This sample handles x402 payment verification within the application Lambda functions. An alternative approach moves payment verification to the edge using Amazon CloudFront and Lambda@Edge. This separates payment logic from application code and applies x402 to any origin without backend changes.

For a reference implementation of this pattern, see the [CloudFront + Lambda@Edge x402 example](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/examples/typescript/servers/cloudfront-lambda-edge) in the Coinbase x402 repository.

1. **Open the application** in your browser at the deployed Amplify URL or `http://localhost:5173` for local development.

2. **Select architecture:** Click "Serverless" in the top navigation.

3. **Select model:** Choose "Nova LLM" for text generation or "Nova Canvas" for image generation.

4. **Connect wallet:** Click the wallet button (👛) to open the WalletConnect modal. Select your wallet and approve the connection. Ensure you are on Base Sepolia network.

5. **Submit a prompt:** Type your request in the chat input and press Enter or click the send button.

6. **Review payment:** A modal displays the estimated cost in USDC. Click "Confirm" to proceed.

7. **Sign transaction:** Your wallet prompts you to sign the EIP-712 message. This authorizes the USDC transfer but does not execute it yet.

8. **Receive content:** After payment verification and settlement, the AI-generated content appears in the chat along with the transaction URL.

### Agentic Architecture (Autonomous Agent)

1. **Open the application** and select "Agentic" in the top navigation.

2. **Verify connection:** The green indicator (🟢) confirms WebSocket connection to the agent.

3. **Submit a prompt:** Type your image generation request and press Enter.

4. **Agent processing:** The agent autonomously estimates cost, verifies balance, authorizes payment, and generates content.

5. **Receive content:** The generated image and transaction confirmation appear in the chat.

### Example Conversation

```
User: What can you help me with?

Agent: I can help you with several image-related tasks:

       🎨 Image Generation
       - Create images using Amazon Nova Canvas based on your text descriptions
       - Handle the payment process automatically through x402 protocol

       💰 Wallet Management
